# the-odin-project-google-home-page

This is my very first attempt at coding something in HTML from scratch.  I had done this years ago on myspace and I am learning this to start a new career.
All comments/critiques are welcome.  Go easy on me.  I only did the lessons from theOdinProject and Freecodeacademy and hadn't really done any actual page coding until now.
Cheers!
